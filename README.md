# library-collection
This project was initated to refresh my knowledge of Visual Studio.
It is written in Visual Basic as this is my earliest and most familiar language
although I have written in C# and also coded asp.net projects.
It remains in development mode although I have used it to store over 500 books
in a SQL Server (localDB) database.
